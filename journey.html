                    <p style="color:#030303">Starting in early 2020, I learnt the <b>basics of programming on Khan Academy</b> and later on I went to <b>learn Python</b>. My interest in data science began there.
                        <br>As I explored the topic, I learned the essentials of three Python libraries:
                        <u><a href="https://numpy.org/" target="#">NumPy</a></u>,
                        <u><a herf="https://pandas.pydata.org/"  target="#">pandas</a></u> and
                        <u><a href="https://matplotlib.org/"  target="#">Matplotlib</a></u>. Then, I did a few really <b>basic projects</b> related to the topic. You can find one
                        <u><a href="https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/another-data-science-project"  target="#">here</a></u>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <a href="#Getting to know what I like and don't like in other areas">
                        <h3 style="text-align:left" id="Getting to know what I like and don't like in other areas">Getting to know what I like and don't like in other areas</h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>I decided after some time to <b>learn java, c, </b>and <b>C++ </b>. Because of my interest in electrical engineering, C was the programming language I used most of the time. While learning Java and C++, I only made <b>very simple console</b>                        applications to practice the languages.

                        <br>Following this, I began to learn the <b>basics of web development</b>. It consisted of <b>HTML, CSS,</b> and <u><a href="https://www.javascript.com/"  target="#"><b>Javascript</b></a></u>. Also, I have dedicated time to understanding
                        how to work with
                        <u><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"  target="#">bootstrap</a></u>.


                        <br>Following that, I began to devote myself to <b>learning</b> <u><a href="https://reactjs.org/"  target="#">react</a></u>(free and open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components) as well as <u><a href="https://reactnative.dev/"  target="#">react native</a></u>(mobile
                        application framework which uses react with the native platform capabilities)


                        <br>Eventually, at the beginning of 2021, I <b>installed</b> <u><a href="https://www.kali.org/" target="#" > kali linux</a></u> in a <u><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="#" >virtual machine</a></u> for the first time.
                        With the <b>help</b> of an online course, I <b>learned</b> about <u><a href="https://nmap.org/"  target="#">Nmap</a></u>,
                        <u><a href="https://www.metasploit.com/" target="#" >Metasploit</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="#" >Wireshark</a></u>.
                        <br> To learn more about <u><a href="https://www.metasploit.com/" target="#" >Metasploit</a></u>, I <b>installed</b> the vulnerable operating system of <u><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/" target="#"  >Metaesploidable</a></u>                        in a virtual Box. I got bored after a short time, as my interest in this area <b>faded away</b>, as well as my computer malfunctioning. So I decided to build a <b>Personal portefolio</b> using an HTML template found in this <u><a href="https://html5up.net/"  target="#">site</a></u>.
                        With time, I <b>changed the website</b> to the one you see now. Here is a link to the <u><a href="https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/old-personal-portefolio"  target="#">old site code</a></u>. can be found here.


                        <br>After a while, I began to learn and discover <b>machine learning</b> with Python. In order to explore some of the Python <b>libraries</b> and <b>frameworks</b> listed <u><a href="https://awesome-python.com/"  target="#">here</a></u>                        and ultimately to <b>use</b> <u><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/"  target="#">Tensorflow</a></u>
                        </u>

                    </a>
                    <p>My current goals are to learn more about arduinos, IoT (Internet of Things), databases, operating systems and to contribute to open source projects.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>I found the most difficult part of learning programming to be understanding <b>how to guide</b> myself throughout such a large field and how to deal with disappointment and setbacks

                    </p>
                    <br>

                    </a>
                    <p>Programming <b>taught me a lot</b> about computers, servers, machine learning, web development, and much more when I was still in high school (2020/2021).</p>
                    <p>Programming, to me, has enabled me to build different <b>skills</b>, such as:

                        <ul>
                            <li>How to solve problems</li>
                            <li>How to aproach a new field:where to look out for</li>
                            <li>How to deal with continous failure</li>
                            <li>How to learn faster</li>
                            <li>And many others...</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
